# Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation 

## [Medical Application Overview](./research/application_medical_overview.md)
## [Documents](./research/documents.md)
## [Literature Review](./research/literature_review.md)

## IDEA
- Use techniques of previous research
- Design new loss function (using the idea of previous paper)
- Reduce size of models
- Handle the open problems of previous research
- Design new model: cascaded, because they are overlap

## Experiments
My code is located at: https://github.com/thanhhau097/pytorch-3dunet which was folked from https://github.com/wolny/pytorch-3dunet with modification.

### Difference between (3) and (5), what things in (3) should be integrate into (5)?
- Customized preprocessing data

### Step-by-Step
1. Train model with only WT label, try to improve it 
      1.1 with original Unet, try to modify loss function, preprocessing data,... to get best loss function and data.
      1.2 With modified architecture
2. Train model will all labels, in parallel/separate-cascade/end2end cascade
