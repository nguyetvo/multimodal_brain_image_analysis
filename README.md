# Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation 

## [Medical Application Overview](./research/application_medical_overview.md)
## [Documents](./research/documents.md)
## [Literature Review](./research/literature_review.md)

## IDEA
- Use techniques of previous research
- Design new loss function (using the idea of previous paper)
- Reduce size of models
- Handle the open problems of previous research
- Design new model: cascaded, because they are overlap

## Experiments
