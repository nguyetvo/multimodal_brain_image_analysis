# Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation 

## IDEA
- Use techniques of previous research
- Design new loss function (using the idea of previous paper)
- Reduce size of models
- Handle the open problems of previous research
- Design new model: cascaded, because they are overlap

The region outside the brain is set to 0. As opposed to normalizing the entire image including the background, this strategy will yield comparative intensity values within the brain region irrespective of the size of the background region around it.<br>- Postprocessing: The BraTS challenge awards a Dice score of 1 if a label is absent in both the ground truth and the prediction. Conversely, only a single false positive voxel in a patient where no enhancing tumor is present in the ground truth will result in a Dice score of 0. Therefore we replace all enhancing tumor voxels with necrosis if the total number of predicted enhancing tumor is less than some threshold<br>- Disadvantage of Dice loss |                                                              One of the main challenges with brain tumor segmentation is the class imbalance in the dataset.<br>Small data, need to avoid overfitting<br>Could we use cascade model?
